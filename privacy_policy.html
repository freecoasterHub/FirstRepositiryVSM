    <h1>Privacy Policy for MemoCards</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 21, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using MemoCards. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Personal Information (Google Sign-In)</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in with their Google account. When you sign in, we may collect and store the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Account ID</strong> (a unique identifier for your Google account)</li>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> (if provided by Google)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used solely for authentication purposes and to associate your personal dictionaries and settings with your account. If you do not sign in, we create an anonymous user ID to provide basic functionality.</p>

    <h3>1.2 User-Generated Content (Dictionaries)</h3>
    <p>MemoCards allows you to create or upload dictionary files (word lists). These files may be stored in Firebase (Firestore or Storage) so that you can access them across devices. The content of these dictionaries is not shared publicly unless you explicitly choose to do so.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>We may automatically collect certain information when you use the app, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> features used, time spent in the app, and other diagnostic data.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID (AdID):</strong> used to serve personalized or non-personalized ads through Google AdMob, in accordance with your device settings and Google’s advertising policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Collected Information</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Storing Content</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase (Firestore/Storage) to store user-created dictionaries and related data. This allows you to access your dictionaries from multiple devices and keep your data synced.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Authentication</h3>
    <p>Firebase Authentication (including Google Sign-In) is used to securely associate your data (such as dictionaries) with your user account. This helps us ensure only you can access or modify your content.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Remote Config</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Remote Config to dynamically configure certain aspects of the app (for example, managing the priority or usage of different AI APIs). This does not collect personal data from you; it only allows us to adjust app behavior.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Advertising</h3>
    <p>We integrate Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may use your device’s Advertising ID (AdID) to serve personalized or non-personalized ads, in accordance with your device settings and Google’s advertising policies. You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings.</p>

    <h3>2.5 Improving the Service</h3>
    <p>Automatically collected information (e.g., usage data, device info) helps us understand how users interact with the app and improve functionality and user experience.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties, except as described below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase Services:</strong> We use Firebase (provided by Google) for authentication, data storage, and remote config. Google may have access to some usage and device data for analytics and service improvement.</li>
      <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> Advertising partners may collect and use device information (including Advertising ID) to provide relevant ads. This data is processed in accordance with Google’s advertising policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may also share aggregated, anonymized information (e.g., total number of users) for research or analytical purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. This includes using secure connections (HTTPS) and following best practices for data storage.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Managing Your Content:</strong> You can create, edit, or delete your dictionaries at any time within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Account:</strong> You can sign out of your Google account or revoke permissions via your Google account settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising Settings:</strong> You can opt out of personalized ads on your device by changing your device settings (e.g., “Opt out of Ads Personalization”).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be posted on this page with the date of the latest update. We recommend periodically checking this page for changes.</p>
