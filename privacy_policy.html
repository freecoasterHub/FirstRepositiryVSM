    <h1>Privacy Policy for MemoCards</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 24, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using MemoCards. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Personal Information (Google Sign-In)</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in with their Google account. When you sign in, we may collect and store the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Account ID</strong> (a unique identifier for your Google account)</li>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> (if provided by Google)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used solely for authentication purposes and to associate your personal dictionaries and settings with your account. If you do not sign in, we create an anonymous user ID to provide basic functionality.</p>

    <h3>1.2 User-Generated Content (Dictionaries)</h3>
    <p>MemoCards allows you to create or upload dictionary files (word lists). These files may be stored in Firebase (Firestore or Storage) so that you can access them across devices. The content of these dictionaries is not shared publicly unless you explicitly choose to do so.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>We may automatically collect certain information when you use the app, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> features used, time spent in the app, and other diagnostic data.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID (AdID):</strong> used to serve personalized or non-personalized ads through Google AdMob, in accordance with your device settings and Google’s advertising policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Analytics and Usage Metrics</h4>
    <p>We use Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics for Firebase (GA4), Meta SDK, and Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymized usage data. This may include events such as <code>app_open</code>, <code>screen_view</code>, <code>word_view</code>, <code>training_start</code>, <code>training_complete</code>, <code>ai_description_request</code>, and <code>achievement_unlocked</code>. These metrics help us understand how users interact with the app, measure learning progress (“Learning Active Time”), analyze engagement, and improve the learning experience. All analytics data is anonymized and does not include any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Collected Information</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Storing Content</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase (Firestore/Storage) to store user-created dictionaries and related data. This allows you to access your dictionaries from multiple devices and keep your data synced.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Authentication</h3>
    <p>Firebase Authentication (including Google Sign-In) is used to securely associate your data (such as dictionaries) with your user account. This helps us ensure only you can access or modify your content.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Remote Config</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Remote Config to dynamically configure certain aspects of the app (for example, managing the priority or usage of different AI APIs). This does not collect personal data from you; it only allows us to adjust app behavior.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Advertising</h3>
    <p>We integrate Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may use your device’s Advertising ID (AdID) to serve personalized or non-personalized ads, in accordance with your device settings and Google’s advertising policies. You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings.</p>

    <h3>2.5 Improving the Service</h3>
    <p>We analyze anonymized usage data (from GA4, Firebase Analytics, and Meta SDK) to understand how users engage with MemoCards. Metrics such as learning activity duration, session length, or feature usage help us improve user experience, optimize training efficiency, and measure overall learning progress. All collected analytics data is aggregated and does not include any personal or dictionary content.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing Information with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties, except as described below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase Services:</strong> We use Firebase (provided by Google) for authentication, data storage, analytics, and remote configuration. Google may have access to some anonymized usage and device data for service improvement, under its privacy policy.</li>
      <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> Advertising partners may collect and use device information (including Advertising ID) to provide relevant ads. This data is processed in accordance with Google’s advertising policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Crashlytics:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics collects technical data about app errors and crashes (e.g., device type, OS version, and stack trace). No personal content or dictionary data is transmitted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may also share aggregated, anonymized information (e.g., total number of users or average study time) for research, product analytics, or investor reporting. These datasets never contain any identifiable user data.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. This includes using secure connections (HTTPS) and following best practices for encryption and access control within Firebase. Crashlytics and Analytics use anonymized identifiers and comply with Google’s data protection standards (GDPR and CCPA).</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Managing Your Content:</strong> You can create, edit, or delete your dictionaries at any time within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Account:</strong> You can sign out of your Google account or revoke permissions via your Google account settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising Settings:</strong> You can opt out of personalized ads on your device by changing your device settings (e.g., “Opt out of Ads Personalization”).</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics & Diagnostics:</strong> You can disable analytics data collection (Firebase Analytics, Meta SDK, or Crashlytics) via your device privacy settings. On Android, go to <em>Settings → Privacy → Ads</em> and select “Delete Advertising ID” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization.” MemoCards will continue to function normally, but anonymized usage statistics will no longer be collected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be posted on this page with the date of the latest update. We recommend periodically checking this page for changes.</p>
